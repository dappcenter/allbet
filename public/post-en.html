      <p>1.	Will AB token be given out as dividends?</p>
No. The presale part will be worked as daily expenses and promoting.</br></br>

<p>2.	Can the 30% AB held by developing team join in the dividends?</p>
The 30% AB held by the team is locked and is released for the same ratio as mining. The released part can also take part in the dividends. Besides, initial AB held by the team is completely locked. We promise not to sell it after allbet launches on exchanges.</br></br>

<p>3.	If users only hold ETH AB ( ERC20 token), do they only get ETH as dividends?</p>
No, users can get dividends based on what kinds of token on the dividend pool. That is to say, even when a user only hold ETH AB, he can not only get dividends of ETH, but also TRX and EOS.</br>
In addition, no matter what kinds of AB, the function, rights and interests are the same.</br></br>

<p>4.	Why doesn’t AB show up in the wallet after users withdraw AB from ALLBET?</p>
Login your wallet, and find TRC20 token address. Copy and pasta TNbYoP22d74RWy4ETssHsXYFrnmmbQ2fvt. Click it and you should see the balance of AB.</br></br>

<p>5.	Why does an user’ wallet deduct more than 10 TRX after the user bet 10TRX in the game?</p>
It’s because TRON mainnet deducts mainnet fee. Users need to freeze TRX in the wallet to increase bandwidth and energy to decrease tron mainnet fee.</br></br>

<p>6.	What are dividends made up of? If the development team give out 100% profits as dividends, how do they make money?</p>
Dividends are from platform earnings which will be given out completely as dividends.</br>
Developing team holds 30% AB which is locked. The team values the long development of AB and aims to make the platform well-known, getting more recognition. Only in this way can make AB valuable.</br></br>

<p>7.	When does the presale of AB end?</p>
The presale is due to end on the midday of January 1st (Eastern Eight Zones). If the raise finishes in advance, the presale will also end ahead of time.</br></br>

<p>8.	Why can’t users buy AB on DEX exchange?</p>
AB hasn’t been launched on exchanges. After the dividends are available, launching on the exchange will be taken into account. For now, AB can only be purchased on the platform.</br></br>

<p>9.	When is the dividend available? How long will ALLBET give out dividends and how to get dividends?</p>
Dividends are available after the presale ends and will be carried out every day. 100% earnings of the day before will be given out as dividends. Staking your AB in the platform and you can get dividends immediately.</br></br>

<p>10. How to deal with unsold AB?</p>
Unsold AB will be locked. Moreover, only AB staked in the platform can join in the dividends. AB , which is not staked in the platform such as locked, unsold and in the wallet, cannot join in the dividends.</br></br>

<p>11. Do uses need to leave AB in the platform?</p>
No, but users need to pledge AB in ALLBET.</br></br>

<p>12. What is the subsequent plans of ALLBET?</p>
ALLBET subsequent plans are to strengthen promotion, online events, enlarge user scale to improve user experience and start dividends.</br></br>

<p>13. Is there any new game in the future? What’s the difference of Dice game between ALLBET and competitors?</p>
ALLBET has been developing other kinds of games such as lottery and poker.</br>
According to different users’ preference, ALLBET supports different coins ( ETH, EOS, TRX, AB) to play games.</br></br>

<p>14.	Why doesn’t AB won in the game show up in the wallet？</p>
Users need to withdraw AB in tab ‘Presale’-‘Mine’ to their wallets.</br></br>

<p>15.	Why doesn’t users’ AB amount mined show up in the wallet, but it does when brought through the presale?</p>
Mining times are absolutely more than ones of presale. If the amount of AB through mining is transferred to users’ wallet every time after users mining, the service charge is high. In case of this, AB that is mined is left in the platform. If users need transfer AB to their wallets, they firstly have to withdraw it.</br></br>
