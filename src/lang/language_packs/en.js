        homeAlletDesc: "DB is allbet Token, with a fixed total of 10 million. It is an application-based certificate that represents allbet users and developer rights in the allbet ecosystem. It is also an important link between wallets, users and project developers. After the issuance, all the certificates are stored in a contract-controlled DB card pool (non-team hold), and there is a corresponding ETH fund pool. The user purchases the pass from the pass pool, and the spent ETH will enter the ETH fund pool (non-team hold). All operations are directly controlled by the contract, and information on the blockchain can be checked.",
